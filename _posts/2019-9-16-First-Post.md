### Bayes' Theorem  
Bayes' Theorem is very helpful in building intelligent systems.  For example, a smart defect detector installed on a production line can be used for finding defective items more efficiently. Bayes' Theorem also has presence in many Machine Learning models used for filtering out spam emails or recognizing human speech.  It finds us the true probability from an observation and makes an essential part in decision making.
